- tile, untile, thresh: works fine on md, Color
- vignettes build OK
- translate: check param input OK
- keeping correct storage.mode after binary operations on TrueColor images
- deprecated functions moved to deprecated.R
- vignette changes: (indexing a[,,,1] instead of a[,,1] and promote usage of rgbImage)
- unit test inst/scripts/test.R added

2.7.5
