1. UNIX/Linux and Mac OS installation

EBImage requires the following softwares to be installed:
1) pkg-config
2) gtk+-2.0
3) ImageMagick

On UNIX/Linux systems, pkg-config and gtk+-2.0 are most likely present. 
ImageMagick is available in many UNIX distributions (Ubuntu,
Debian, Fedora, Suse). Alternatively, you may download and compile it 
from 'http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php#unix'.

On Mac OS systems, an easy way to get these tools is to first install 
MacPorts from 'http://www.macports.org/'. To install MacPorts, you'll need
to install the XCode developement suite and the X11 SDK on your machine. 
These tools are located in the DVDs shipped with your Mac. The commands 
'sudo port install ImageMagick' and 'sudo port install gtk2' will then 
install the required softwares. Before installing or using EBImage, you'll 
have to start the X11 server, located in the Application/Utilities directory.
The new release of EBImage will be much easier to install on MacOS systems.
Drop me an email (gregoire.pau@ebi.ac.uk) if you have troubles to install
EBImage on MacOS systems.

Please note that the development versions (with C header and libraries) of 
gtk+-2.0 and ImageMagick are needed to install EBImage.

Just download and install the package EBImage from Bioconductor then or do
a "biocLite('EBImage')" in R or "R CMD INSTALL ." in a terminal located in
a the EBImage package directory to install EBImage.

EBImage works fine with gtk+-2.0 2.12.9 and ImageMagick 6.3.7 Q16.

2. Windows installation

EBImage requires the following softwares to be installed:
1) gtk+-2.0
2) ImageMagick

The gtk+-2.0 bundle can be downloaded from 'http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.16/gtk+-bundle_2.16.0-20090317_win32.zip'
or 'http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html' (select the binary GTK+ all-in-one bundle).
Please install it somewhere (C:\gtk, for example) and please tick the checkbox 
to install the development tools.

ImageMagick can be downloaded from 'http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows'. 
Select the Q16 DLL version and install it on your computer.

Just download and install the package EBImage from Bioconductor.

EBImage works fine with gtk+-2.0 2.12.9 and ImageMagick 6.3.7 Q16.
