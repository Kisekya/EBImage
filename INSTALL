Linux/UNIX Installation Notes
------------------------------------------------------------
To install EBImage on a Linux/Unix system you will need a
working copy of R and the working copy of ImageMagick and
Magick++ libraries and header files versioned 6.x.x. 
Refer to www.imagemagick.org for the installation procedures of
ImageMagick, but generally to compile and install it from
source you need to run (in its unpacked directory):

./configure
make
make install

Additionally you might need to run

make install-lib
make install-headers

to install a development version (but usually this is not 
required with new versions of ImageMagick).

If you use an rpm based Linux, please be sure to include rpms

ImageMagick
ImageMagick-devel
ImageMagick-Magick++
ImageMagick-Magick++-devel

Names can differ depending on the distribution.

Before compiling EBImage, please ensure that Magick++-config
(installed with ImageMagick devel) is in your path (normally
in /usr/bin), simply run it as:
Magick++-config --cppflags - the result should be somthing like
-I/usr/include or wherever your Magick++ include files are located.

Apple MacOS Installation Notes
------------------------------------------------------------
One can install ImageMagick from source in exactly the same 
manner as described above, or one can use preinstalled version (not
recommended) delivered with the system. In both cases, if problems occur
please refer to the notes below.

------------------------------------------------------------
ImageMagick comes preinstalled on Apple Mac. However there are
some missing dependencies. Compilation requires libjasper and
libjpeg to be present on the system.

Get Jasper from http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/ and
compile as usual. This should solve -ljasper dependency problem.

To compile libjpeg, get the source from http://www.ijg.org.
You will need Apple analogue of libtool (glibtool) in order to
compile a shared library from the source. Use fink from
http://fink.sourceforge.net to install glibtool. Then, see the
comments from Firas:

I managed to install the EBImage package. There were some problems
with installing libjpeg.so. Here is a description of the whole
process of installing ImageMagick:

1: ./configure --enable-shared --enable-static
Did not manage to identify the OS and printed an error message.

2: Trying "make", despite the error, returned an error concerning
libtool: The variable LIBTOOL was assigned the value "./libtool"
(error: libtool was not found in the local directory). Trying to
change the value to "libtool" did not solve the problem, since it
is an Apple "libtool", which uses a different syntax (e.g. No
--mode= option).

3: To solve that, I used fink ( http://fink.sourceforge.net/) to
install GNU libtool, which is named glibtool. Changing the "libtool"
in the Makefile to "glibtool" solved the problem and produced libjpeg.so.
Running R CMD INSTALL worked and installed EBImage.
