Linux Installation Notes
------------------------------------------------------------
To install EBImage on a Linux/Unix system you will need a
working copy of R and the latest version of ImageMagick and
Magick++ libraries and header files. If installing ImageMagick
from source you will need to compile it and run

make
make install

Additionally you might need to run

make install-lib
make install-headers

to install a development version.

If you use an rpm based Linux, please be sure to include

ImageMagick
ImageMagick-devel
ImageMagick-Magick++
ImageMagick-Magick++-devel

rpms (names can differ depending on the distribution).

Before compiling EBImage, please ensure that Magick++-config
(installed with ImageMagick devel) is in your path (normally
in /usr/bin).

Apple Mac Installation Notes
------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to Firas Swidan <swidanf@hhmi.org>
------------------------------------------------------------
ImageMagick comes preinstalled on Apple Mac. However there are
some missing dependencies. Compilation requires libjasper and
libjpeg to be present on the system.

Get Jasper from http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/ and
compile as usual. This should solve -ljasper dependency problem.

To compile libjpeg, get the source from http://www.ijg.org.
You will need Apple analogue of libtool (glibtool) in order to
compile a shared library from the source. Use fink from
http://fink.sourceforge.net to install glibtool. Then, see the
comments from Firas:

I managed to install the EBImage package. There were some problems
with installing libjpeg.so. Here is a description of the whole
process:

1: ./configure --enable-shared --enable-static
Did not manage to identify the OS and printed an error message.

2: Trying "make", despite the error, returned an error concerning
libtool: The variable LIBTOOL was assigned the value "./libtool"
(error: libtool was not found in the local directory). Trying to
change the value to "libtool" did not solve the problem, since it
is an Apple "libtool", which uses a different syntax (e.g. No
--mode= option).

3: To solve that, I used fink ( http://fink.sourceforge.net/) to
install GNU libtool, which is named glibtool. Changing the "libtool"
in the Makefile to "glibtool" solved the problem and produced libjpeg.so.
Running R CMD INSTALL worked and installed EBImage.
