idea: how to count objects based on original distance maps
--------------------------------------------------
while (maxValue of the array > 0)
    - get index of the first occurance of the max value. one of our objects
    - values at points about this one are not larger - add them to the selection
      until we hit background or the neighbouring value will be larger than at the current
      point or we reach the maximum radius (= max object diameter)
    - the size of the selection - somehow proportional to the object size (think of it)
      as well as the value at the max point is proportional to the object size
    - reset the selection to the background to exclude from consequent runs!
