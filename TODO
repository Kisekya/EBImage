high:
- floodFill: check md and Color
- fillHull works only with IndexedImage
- doc: major update to be done (main + features + cthresh + athresh)
- drawtext: check md and Color (IM, should be OK)
- propagate: check md and Color
- paintObjects, matchObjects, stackObjects: check md and Color
- installation: ease the installation on MacOS
- merge morphKern, mkball and mkbox
- check previous vignette
- check features values with current EBImage release
- channel: two methods, rewrite vignette and usecases

low:
- remove lib_ things
- toremove: enhance (vague)
- toremove: header (not useful anymore)
- merge animate and display
- change colormode/colorMode case
- default arguments to be checked
- clean display.c (winStr, newPixbufFromImages to remove)
- assert is misnamed
- image, hist: are they useful ?
- naiveSegment: to implement
- subset [1,1:10] or [1:10,1] doesn't have the good orientation
- check display colorize and main
- ref, checkCompatible should test for validity and storage.mode of ref
- R testing using hashing

EBImage-deprecated.html man page: 
- "The functions are likely to be defunct with the next Bioconductor release, 2.2." but the last release was already 2.3 ...

drawtext man page:
Clean up 'Value' section. Explain what drawtext and drawfont functions
   do.

Remove the weird functions 'ensureStorageMode' and '.ImageCall'


zernikeMoments function and man page: 
   1.) What is the 'apply.Gaussian = TRUE' argument doing? It seems
   bizarre. Does it make sense? Same question for 'pseudo'.
   2.) The function used to compute the Zernike polynomials should be 
   exposed (e.g. it could take the values of n and l, and a
   parameterisation of a grid of points in R^2 on which the values 
   should be computed; it could return the values on this grid.)

Do we need "colormode" in readImage and as an attribute of the Image
   class? Wouldn't it be enough to have this as an argument of 'display'
   and 'writeImage', to ask these functions to attempt to interpret
   the third dimension of the Image object as three RGB color
   channels? Everything else in the package should not really depend
   on this (some functions might require the third dimesion to be of
   size 1).
 
How are we going to represent 3D 'images' (x,y,z), and time?
