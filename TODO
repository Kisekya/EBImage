##########
1) Objects
##########

'colorMode':
-----------
Why is this sometimes spelt with uppercase 'M' (e.g. in accessor
functions) and sometimes with lowercase (e.g. in the 'Image' 
constructor and in the slotname)?  Both are exposed to users - 
and they might be happier about some more consistency.

'validity':
----------
There should be a validity method for Image objects. Currently it is 
possible to create invalid object e.g. with "new" that break e.g. the "show" 
method:

> a=new("Image")
> a

'Image'
  colorMode()   : Grayscale
  storage class : numeric 3D array, writable images in range [0..1]
Errore in if (dimobject[3] > 1) cat(sprintf("  dim()         : %dx%d, %d image(s)\n",  : 
  valore mancante dove Ã¨ richiesto TRUE/FALSE

IndexedImage & storage.mode:
----------------------------
GP thinks that this class is useless and can be easily combined with Image.
storage.mode of Images must remain 'numeric' and everything can be done in 'numeric'. 

n-dimension:
--------------
GP thinks that EBImage should be able to deal with n-dimensional images and NOT cast 
everything into 3D arrays. 

arrays, matrices:
----------------
GP thinks that EBImage should also be able to work with matrices and arrays, not only with Images.

color handling:
--------------
GP thinks that EBImage color management should include:
- remove the TrueColor and Grayscale modes
- readImage should read by default color
- render the colors only during display() using channels
- don't restrict to RGB !

##########
2) Methods
##########

general:
-------
GP thinks that methods should be clearly sorted according to their level (low-level, high-level) 
depending on the genericity of their behavior and according to the field they 
belong to (i/o, displaying, linear filtering, morphological operations...).

Matlab's image toolbox is a good example of how an image processing toolbox should be.

GP thinks that default arguments in many methods are overused.

consider removing:
------------------
GP thinks the following functions should be removed
- 'copy' (what is the difference with a<-b ??)
- 'header' (weird function, is it still useful since several attributes are now gone ?)
- 'frameDist' (experimental, too vaguely defined, too specific usage)
- 'animate' (should be combined with 'display' when GTK is absent)
- 'morphKern' (should be merged with mkball, mkbox into a mkshape)
- 'mkbox' (see morphKern)
- 'mkball' (see morphKern)
- 'fill' floodFill is doing the job
- 'rgbImage' (won't be useful in a new color management system)
- 'channelMix' (won't be useful in a new color management system)
- 'chooseImage' (file selector, out of subject, RGtk2)

source code: renaming files:
----------------------------
GP thinks it would be nice to have a coherent R method/R source/C filename naming...

installation:
-------------
ease the MacOS Gtk+ and installalation procedure
