Takes forever for radius > 10 (on large images)

Somehow argument dy is not used. Image is always scaled proportionally
depending on the dx argument. Wrong documentation of ImageMagick?

? [WH 26/04/06] rgb
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of the logical flag "rgb" can we have a factor with
levels "rgb", "grayscale", this would be more extendable in case we
ever need additional image types

-------------------------------------------------------------------
what about this algorithm:
1. Find all local maxima
2. Merge those that are too close together, allow not only for
   maximal point but also maximal regions (e.g. ridges)
3. Define as many regions as there as maxima, and seed them by the maxima.
4. Apply a simultaneous floodfill to all the regions
(I might try out this algorithm as soon as a I find time; on advantage
that I see is that it works simultaneously on the regions rather than
greedily one after another, greedy algorithms are simply but often
rather suboptimal)

I think for our type of applications it would also be good to
be able to emit warnings or an error if the images have different sizes (because
in an HT screen, we expect them all to be the same size)
