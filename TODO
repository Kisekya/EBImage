- installation: ease the installation on MacOS
- channel: two methods, rewrite vignette and usecases
- change colormode/colorMode case
- image, hist: are they useful ?
- subset [1,1:10] or [1:10,1] doesn't have the good orientation
- remove gene1.tif

wolfgang:

drawtext man page:
Clean up 'Value' section. Explain what drawtext and drawfont functions
   do.

zernikeMoments function and man page: 
   2.) The function used to compute the Zernike polynomials should be 
   exposed (e.g. it could take the values of n and l, and a
   parameterisation of a grid of points in R^2 on which the values 
   should be computed; it could return the values on this grid.)
