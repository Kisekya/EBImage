high:
- floodFill: check md and Color
- fillHull works only with IndexedImage
- doc: major update to be done (main + features + cthresh + athresh)
- drawtext: check md and Color (IM, should be OK)
- propagate: check md and Color
- paintObjects, matchObjects, stackObjects: check md and Color
- installation: ease the installation on MacOS
- merge morphKern, mkball and mkbox
- check previous vignette
- check features values with current EBImage release
- channel: two methods, rewrite vignette and usecases

low:
- remove lib_ things
- toremove: enhance (vague)
- toremove: header (not useful anymore)
- merge animate and display
- change colormode/colorMode case
- default arguments to be checked
- clean display.c (winStr, newPixbufFromImages to remove)
- assert is misnamed
- image, hist: are they useful ?
- naiveSegment: to implement
- subset [1,1:10] or [1:10,1] doesn't have the good orientation
- check display colorize and main
- ref, checkCompatible should test for validity and storage.mode of ref
- R testing using hashing

wolfgang:
- the explanation of argument colormode should mention the other possible values besides "Grayscale"
- "Details" talks about choose.image even though that function name occurs nowhere else, and it is deprecated.
- The "Examples" still use TrueColor even that is deprecated as well. 
- wouldb't it make sense to document the argument "main" of the "display" method for ImageX? Also, the way the default value of this argument is currently handled does not work: the window title is always "x".
