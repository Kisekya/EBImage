- example EBImage, makebrush
- floodFill: check md and Color
- fillHull works only with IndexedImage
- drawtext: check md and Color (IM, should be OK)
- propagate: check md and Color
- paintObjects, matchObjects, stackObjects: check md and Color
- installation: ease the installation on MacOS
- check previous vignette
- channel: two methods, rewrite vignette and usecases
- validObject must check image validity even if it is array (stopifnot to be removed)
- readImage of IndexedImage in Grayscale
- toremove: enhance (vague)
- change colormode/colorMode case
- image, hist: are they useful ?
- naiveSegment: to implement
- subset [1,1:10] or [1:10,1] doesn't have the good orientation
- ref, checkCompatible should test for validity and storage.mode of ref

wolfgang:

drawtext man page:
Clean up 'Value' section. Explain what drawtext and drawfont functions
   do.

zernikeMoments function and man page: 
   2.) The function used to compute the Zernike polynomials should be 
   exposed (e.g. it could take the values of n and l, and a
   parameterisation of a grid of points in R^2 on which the values 
   should be computed; it could return the values on this grid.)
